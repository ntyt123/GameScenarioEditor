GameScenarioEditor
==================

There is a game scenario editor,It can be used to write game scenario.You can create new XML Document with specific format by it,or read and edit specific format XML by it.I create it due to my new mobile game(Unity3D),I'm a new programmer.I am unsatisfied with it becouse of capability and the capacity of final XML Document.For cutting down the capacity of final document,I used simplified letter.I'm not satisfied with that.If you have some suggestions,Welcome.Some comments are write by Chinese,if you can't understand,please Email me,Thank you! (You can use 'create new' button to create new right format blank XML document)
